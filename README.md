INTRODUCTION
AgriVision is an innovative platform designed to connect landowners and farmers, enabling landowners to make profitable decisions about their land while helping farmers find opportunities to lease land and grow crops. With AI-driven recommendations for land use, AgriVision aims to improve agricultural productivity and rural development.

Responsive UI: A clean and user-friendly interface optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
Seamless Navigation: Redirects users to specific login forms and displays tailored content.
